For the past five years, I’ve been exploring the fascinating space where perception meets robotics. I’ve built systems that help robots balance, walk, fly, and carry out pick-and-place tasks. I’ve also worked on helping robots see the world through 2D or 3D vision and make decisions on their own based on what they see.

A big part of my work has focused on flying robots (ah yes the drones) that inspect infrastructure. I’ve developed software that tells them where to look, how to gather the right data using their onboard sensors, and how to make sense of it all later to create accurate 3D reconstructions. I’ve also worked on smarter ways for robots to collect information, using ideas from advanced machine learning and optimal experiment design.

Lately, I’ve been teaching myself how to make lemon tarts. It’s all a work in progress.
