#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

For the past five years, I’ve been exploring the fascinating space where perception meets robotics. I’ve built systems that help robots balance, walk, fly, and carry out pick-and-place tasks. I’ve also worked on helping robots see the world through 2D or 3D vision and make decisions on their own based on what they see.

A big part of my work has focused on flying robots (ah yes the drones) that inspect infrastructure. I’ve developed software that tells them where to look, how to gather the right data using their onboard sensors, and how to make sense of it all later to create accurate 3D reconstructions. I’ve also worked on smarter ways for robots to collect information, using ideas from advanced machine learning and optimal experiment design.

Lately, I’ve been teaching myself how to make lemon tarts. It’s all a work in progress.
